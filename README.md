# Amazon Rainforest Deforestation Project

### Understanding the effects of human activity using satellite imagery

This team project is part of the Booz Allen Hamilton sponsored Women in Data Science Incubator.  We are using data from a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/planet-understanding-the-amazon-from-space/overview">Kaggle competition</a> to create a multi-label classification model.  Because of imbalanced label distribution, we evaluate our models using F2 score.  We are developing a Dash web app to create an interactive dashboard that plots the predicitions of the trained model.
